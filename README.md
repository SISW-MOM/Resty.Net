Resty.Net
=========

A simple bare to the metal **REST client** for **.net framework** written in **c#**. Serves as a very thin layer above HttpWebRequest object exposes most of its properties. Also provides an option to directly access the underlying HttpWebRequest and HttpWebResponse objects if necessary.
